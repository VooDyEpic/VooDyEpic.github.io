                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>The game is set in the world of Rivellon, years after the first Divinity: Original Sin. The Voidwoken, demonic creatures of the Void, have invaded, and the Magisters—the religious military order of the Divine—are rounding up and imprisoning anyone with the potential to become a Sourcerer, as their powers are believed to be the cause of the Voidwoken invasion.</p>
                <p>You are a Sourcerer, captured by the Magisters and placed on a prison ship heading to the Fort Joy island prison. When the ship is attacked by a kraken-like Voidwoken creature, you escape and wash ashore on Fort Joy. From there, you must find a way to escape the island, all while learning more about your powers as a Godwoken—one who has the potential to become the next Divine.</p>
